> Stock portfolio with clear performance graph.

  

## Why use moneyChamber ?

Most of stock portfolios will look like example below.

[![bad portfolio](https://i.ibb.co/t8bSQYY/Figure-2.png)]()



Portfolio seems to be growing, but at this case, all the growth you can see are mostly deposits. 

That's why I have designed and coded this Python stock portfolio, that excludes deposits and profit is based purely on stock price movement and paid dividends.
